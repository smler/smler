PE refers to obstruction of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches by material (eg, thrombus, tumor, air, or fat) that originated elsewhere in the body. <br>2. Suspect pulmonary embolism in any patient who presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, normal lung exam, hypoxic, and have tachypnea, tachycardia and hypotension.<br>3. The most typical findings of a pulmonary embolism on arterial blood gas sampling are hypoxemia  and hypocarbia.  The most common EKG finding is sinus tachycardia.<br><strong>4. The most common cause of pulmonary embolism is embolization of blood clots from the deep veins of the lower extremities </strong><br>5. The most common symptoms of acute PE are dyspnea at rest or with exertion, pleuritic pain, cough, orthopnea, calf or thigh pain or swelling, and wheezing.<br>6. The most common signs are tachypnea, tachycardia, rales, decreased breath sounds, an accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound, and jugular venous distension. <br>7. <strong>Pulmonary angiography</strong> is the definitive diagnostic technique or "gold standard" in the diagnosis of acute PE.<br>8. <strong>Anticoagulation</strong> is the mainstay of therapy for acute PE.

Anaphylaxis most commonly affects the cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. <br>3. The skin or mucous membranes are involved in 80-90% of cases. <br>4.

Salicylate poisoning can cause vomiting, tinnitus, confusion, hyperthermia, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and multiple organ failure.<br>2. The first sign of salicylate toxicity is often hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis due to medullary stimulation. <br>3. Metabolic acidosis follows, and an increased anion gap results from accumulation of intracellular lactate as well as excretion of bicarbonate by the kidney to compensate for respiratory alkalosis.<br>4. The normal value for the serum anion gap is 8-16 mEq/L. <br>5. Diagnosis is clinical, supplemented by measurement of the anion gap, ABGs, and serum salicylate levels. <br>6.

SE can represent an exacerbation of a preexisting seizure disorder, the initial manifestation of a seizure disorder, or an insult other than a seizure disorder. <br>3. In patients with known epilepsy, <strong>the most common cause is a change in medication.</strong> <br>4. Most seizures terminate spontaneously.<br>5.

MTX inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that reduces folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. This inhibition interferes with DNA synthesis and cell reproduction. <br>3. MTX is used in the treatment of a variety of illnesses including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis<br>4. Methotrexate toxicity develops due to increased patient susceptibility during treatment, excessive parenteral or intrathecal administration, therapeutic errors by patients (e.g. taking MTX orally daily instead of weekly), self-administration to induce abortion, or intentional oral overdoses. <br>5. Clinical manifestations of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, stomatitis, esophagitis, elevated hepatic enzymes, renal failure, rash, myelosuppression (leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia), acute lung injury, tachycardia, hypotension, and neurologic dysfunction (depression, headache, seizures, motor dysfunction, stroke-like symptoms, encephalopathy, coma). <br>6. Toxic effects may occur hours to days to weeks after MTX administration or overdose. <br>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are three antidotes that have been used for MTX toxicity</span>: <strong>leucovorin</strong>, <strong>thymidine</strong> and <strong>glucarpidase</strong>.<br>8. <strong>Leucovorin (folinic acid)</strong> is the reduced and active form of folic acid. It selectively “rescues” normal cells from the toxic effects caused by MTX’s inhibition of the production of reduced folates.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>46. </span> Which of the following is the drug of choice for a child with absence seizures? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Carbamazepine</li><li>Ethosuximide</li><li>Lamotrigine</li><li>Phenytoin</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-ZR9 aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-ZR9 data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-ZR9><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Absence (petit mal) seizures </span></strong><br><br>1.

SE can represent an exacerbation of a preexisting seizure disorder, the initial manifestation of a seizure disorder, or an insult other than a seizure disorder. <br>3. In patients with known epilepsy, the most common cause is a change in medication. <br>4. Most seizures terminate spontaneously.<br>5. Aggressive treatment is necessary for status epileptics. <br><br><strong>Diagnostic criteria (2015)</strong><br>1. Single unremitting seizure lasting &gt;5 minutes OR<br>2. Frequent clinical seizure without inter-ictal return to baseline lasting longer than 5 minutes<br><br><strong>First Step</strong>: <strong>Maintain ABCs; consider rapid intubation for airway protection and if seizures continue, intubate.</strong><br><br><strong>Medications used in the treatment of status epilepticus include the following: </strong><br>1.

Anesthetics (eg, propofol)<br><br>Because of the clinical urgency in treating generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE), however, a 30 minute definition is neither practical nor appropriate in clinical practice.

Ischemic stroke is sudden neurologic deficits that result from focal cerebral ischemia associated with permanent brain infarction (eg, positive results on diffusion-weighted MRI).<br>2. Common causes are (from most to least common) atherothrombotic occlusion of large arteries; cerebral embolism (embolic infarction), lacunar infarction. <br>3. Diagnosis is clinical, but CT or MRI is done to exclude hemorrhage and confirm the presence and extent of stroke.<br>4. Thrombolytic therapy (also known as Fibrinolytic therapy) with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) is recommended in patients with acute ischemic stroke if it can be initiated within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset.<br>5.

Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are re-exposed to the sensitizing antigen.<br>2. Symptoms: cutaneous (eg, hives, flushing, pruritus), gastrointestinal (eg, lip/tongue swelling, vomiting), respiratory (eg, dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxia), and cardiovascular (eg, hypotension).<br>3. Bee stings, food, and medications are the most common allergens. <br>4. Common triggers of anaphylaxis include drugs (eg, beta-lactam antibiotics, allergen extracts), foods (eg, nuts, seafood), proteins (eg, tetanus antitoxin, blood transfusions), animal venoms, and latex.<br>5. Diagnosis is clinical. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate intramuscular administration of epinephrine into the thigh.<br>6. Bronchospasm and upper airway edema may require inhaled or injected beta-agonists and sometimes endotracheal intubation.<br>7. Persistent hypotension requires IV fluids and sometimes vasopressors.<br>8. Primary prevention is avoidance of known triggers.

Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate recognition and intervention.<br>3. Anaphylaxis most commonly affects the cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems.<br>4. Anaphylaxis is primarily a clinical diagnosis.
