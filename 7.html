Serious side effect of the antipsychotics is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tardive dyskinesia</strong></span>, which has been seen with virtually every neuroleptic [<strong>e.g.</strong>, chlorpromazine , fluphenazine , haloperidol ,and thioridazine].<br>2. <strong>Clozapine</strong> is the least likely atypical antipsychotic to cause EPS but is considered to be a medication of last resort because it can cause agranulocytosis. A complete blood count should be done before starting clozapine and throughout treatment to monitor for possible agranulocytosis.<br>3. <strong>Extrapyramidal symptoms</strong> (EPS) frequently occur as side effects of typical antipsychotics but can occasionally occur with atypical antipsychotics. <br>4. Usually, the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear late in treatment and consist of involuntary, repetitive movements of the lips and tongue (e.g., tongue thrusting, lip smacking), and, not infrequently, of the extremities and trunk.<br>5. Patients over 60 and those with pre-existing CNS pathology are at a higher risk for this disorder (up to 70%), but other risk factors have not been confirmed. <br>6. <strong>Clozapine</strong> is called an atypical antipsychotic medication because of its lack of extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia, and would be an appropriate medication for a patient who is developing tardive dyskinesia.<br>7. <strong>Metoclopramide</strong> is a centrally acting antiemetic that has been shown to cause tardive dyskinesia as well.<br>8. <strong>Treatment</strong>: Use newer antipsychotic medications. <br>9.

Iron deficiency anemia is usually caused by blood loss (eg, GI, menstrual) but may be due to hemolysis, malabsorption or increased demand for iron (eg, in pregnancy, lactation, periods of rapid growth in children)<br>3. Symptoms are usually nonspecific. RBCs tend to be microcytic and hypochromic, and iron stores are low, as shown by low serum ferritin and low serum iron levels with high serum total iron-binding capacity. <br>4. Iron deficiency typically causes low serum iron, high iron-binding capacity, and low serum ferritin levels. If the diagnosis is made, occult blood loss should be suspected until proven otherwise. Treatment involves iron replacement and treatment of the cause of blood loss.<br>5. Oral iron supplements are usually adequate; reserve use of parenteral iron for hematologists because of risks of adverse effects (eg, anaphylactoid reactions, serum sickness, thrombophlebitis).</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>85. </span> Which of the following medications is used for the acute treatment of panic attacks? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Nitroglycerin</li><li>Midazolam</li><li>Benzodiazepines</li><li>Fluoxetine</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-ROM aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-ROM data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-ROM><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> C</p>1. <strong>Panic disorder</strong> is characterized by the spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks, the frequency of which can vary from several attacks per day to only a few attacks per year.<br>2.

Panic disorder is the occurrence of repeated panic attacks typically accompanied by fears about future attacks or changes in behavior to avoid situations that might predispose to attacks. <br>6. Diagnosis is clinical. <br>7. Isolated panic attacks may not require treatment.<br>8. Panic disorder is treated with drug therapy, psychotherapy (eg, exposure therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy), or both.<br>9. SSRis, typically fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline, are indicated for this disorder.<br>10. Although benzodiazepines might be appropriate to manage the symptoms of panic disorder, because of their side effects authorities now favor SSRIs as first-line therapy.<br>11. Along with SSRis, patients may benefit from benzodiazepines such as alprazolam. Begin with both and then taper the benzodiazepine given the potential for abuse. <br>12.

Symptoms are usually nonspecific. Such symptoms include fatigue, loss of stamina, shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, and pallor.<br>3. Iron deficiency anemia is usually caused by blood loss (eg, GI, menstrual) but may be due to hemolysis, malabsorption or increased demand for iron (eg, in pregnancy, lactation, periods of rapid growth in children).<br>4. RBCs tend to be microcytic and hypochromic, and iron stores are low, as shown by low serum ferritin and low serum iron levels with high serum total iron-binding capacity.<br>5. Iron deficiency typically causes low serum iron, high iron-binding capacity, and low serum ferritin levels.<br>6. If the diagnosis is made, occult blood loss should be suspected until proven otherwise.<br>7. Treatment involves iron replacement and treatment of the cause of blood loss.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>113. </span> A patient presents with a cough, fever, rhinorrhea, malaise, with conjunctival suffusion.

It is characterized by fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, an enanthem (Koplik spots) on the oral mucosa, and a maculopapular rash that spreads cephalocaudally.<br>3. After a 7- to 14-day incubation period, measles begins with a prodrome of fever, coryza, hacking cough, and tarsal conjunctivitis.<br>4. The rash appears 3 to 5 days after symptom onset, usually 1 to 2 days after Koplik spots appear. It begins on the face in front of and below the ears and on the side of the neck as irregular macules, soon mixed with papules. Within 24 to 48 h, lesions spread to the trunk and extremities (including the palms and soles) as they begin to fade on the face. Petechiae or ecchymoses may occur with severe rashes.<br>5. Diagnosis is usually clinical. <br>6. Treatment is mainly supportive, but children should also receive vitamin A supplementation<br>7. Vaccination is highly effective.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>114. </span> A 22-year-old woman complains the she felt compelled to clean the bathroom over and over again.
