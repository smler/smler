Although the male urethra is a single structure, it is composed of a heterogeneous series of segments: prostatic, membranous, and spongy.<br>3. The membranous urethra is critical to voluntary continence and, because of its rigid attachments, is highly susceptible to injury in pelvic trauma. <br>4. The spongy urethra is surrounded by the corpus spongiosum and forms the terminal conduit communicating with the outside of the body.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Membranous urethra</strong></span><br>The shortest and least distensible portion of the urethra is the membranous urethra. This region spans from the apex of the prostate to the bulb of the penis. It is invested in the external urethral sphincter muscle and the perineal membrane.<br>The membranous urethra passes through the urogenital diaphragm. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the narrowest part of male urethra</span></strong> and is surrounded by the sphincter urethra muscle, which allows voluntary control of the bladder function<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prostatic urethra</strong></span><br>The prostatic urethra is the portion of the urethra that traverses the prostate. It originates in the region of the bladder neck, courses roughly 2.5 cm inferiorly, and terminates at the membranous urethra. <br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spongy urethra</strong></span><br>The spongy urethra is the region that spans the corpus spongiosum of the penis. It is divided into the pendulous urethra and the bulbous (or bulbar) urethra. The pendulous urethra is invested in the corpus spongiosum of the penis in the pendulous portion of the penis. The urethra is located concentrically within the corpus spongiosum.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>4. </span> A 79-year-old man has mild symptoms of prostate enlargement. He has a known medical history of hypertension. Which of the following is the treatment of choice this patient? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Terazosin</li><li>Atenolol</li><li>Oxybutynin</li><li>Prazosin</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-BNK aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-BNK data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-BNK><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> A</p>1. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a non-malignant adenomatous overgrowth of the periurethral prostate gland.<br>2. BPH is extremely common with aging but only sometimes causes symptoms. Symptoms are those of bladder outlet obstruction—weak stream, hesitancy, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, incomplete emptying, terminal dribbling, overflow or urge incontinence, and complete urinary retention. <br>3. Diagnosis is based primarily on digital rectal examination and symptoms; cystoscopy, transrectal ultrasonography, urodynamics, or other imaging studies may also be needed. <br>4. Treatment options include 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, alpha-blockers, tadalafil, and surgery.<br>5. Consider relieving troublesome obstructive symptoms with alpha-adrenergic blockers (eg, terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, alfuzosin), 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), or, if there is concomitant erectile dysfunction, tadalafil.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>5. </span> A 30-year-old man with a history of epileptic seizure presents to the emergency room complaining of left shoulder pain following a seizure.

Anterior<br>2. Posterior<br>3. Inferior <br><strong><br>Anterior dislocations</strong><br>Shoulder dislocations are anterior in ≥ 95% of patients; the mechanism is abduction and external rotation. Associated injuries can include brachial plexus injuries, rotator cuff tears (particularly in elderly patients), fracture of the greater tuberosity, and axillary nerve injury. Shoulder instability and thus recurrent dislocation are common in patients &lt; 30 yr.<br>True anteroposterior (AP) and axillary x-rays are diagnostic for anterior dislocations, showing the humeral head outside the glenoid fossa.<br>Treatment is usually closed reduction using local anesthesia (intra-articular block) or conscious sedation. <br><br><strong>Posterior dislocations</strong><br>Occasionally, dislocations are posterior—a commonly missed injury. It is classically caused by seizures, electric shock, or electroconvulsive therapy done without muscle relaxants.<br>Deformity may not be obvious. The arm is held adducted and internally rotated. Typically, when the elbow is flexed, passive external rotation is impossible. If such rotation is impossible, an AP shoulder x-ray should be taken. If it shows no obvious fracture or dislocation, posterior shoulder dislocation should be considered. A clue to the diagnosis on the AP view is the light bulb or ice cream cone sign; the humeral head is internally rotated, and the tuberosities do not project laterally, making the humeral head appear circular.<br><br><strong>Posterior shoulder dislocations should be suspected in a patient with a recent seizure or electrical burn and shoulder injury or pain.</strong><br><br><strong>Inferior dislocations</strong> (luxatio erecta) are rare and usually clinically obvious; patients hold their arm over their head (ie, abducted to almost 180°), usually with the forearm resting on the head.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>6. </span> A 30-year-old pregnant female presents to the clinic complaining of numbness, pain, and paresthesia in her right palm. Her symptoms are worsened by activity.

It is a medical emergency.<br><br>1. <strong>Gas gangrene</strong> is caused by an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus of the genus Clostridium.<br>2. C perfringens is the most common etiologic agent that causes gas gangrene. Other common clostridial species that cause gas gangrene include Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium fallax, Clostridium histolyticum, and Clostridium tertium.<br>3. Gas gangrene can be classified as posttraumatic, postoperative, or spontaneous.<br>4. Posttraumatic gas gangrene accounts for 60% of all gas gangrene cases<br>5. The typical incubation period for gas gangrene is frequently short (ie, &lt; 24 h), but incubation periods of 1 hour to 6 weeks have been reported.<br>6. Most patients with posttraumatic gas gangrene have sustained serious injury to the skin or soft tissues or have experienced open fractures. Patients with postoperative gas gangrene have frequently undergone recent surgery of the GI or biliary tract.<br>7. A sudden onset of pain is usually the first symptom of gas gangrene. The pain gradually worsens but spreads only as the underlying infection spreads.<br>8. Some patients report a feeling of heaviness in the affected extremity.<br>9. A low-grade fever and apathetic mental status may develop.<br>10. The typical signs and symptoms of gas gangrene include severe pain and tenderness, local swelling to massive edema, skin discoloration with hemorrhagic blebs and bullae, nonodorous or sweet odor, crepitus, fever, relative tachycardia, and altered mental status.<br>11. The combination of aggressive surgical debridement and effective antibiotic therapy is the determining factor for successful treatment of gas gangrene.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>10. </span> Which of the following is not a feature of tension pneumothorax? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Tracheal deviation away from the affected side</li><li>Decreased breath sounds on the affected side</li><li>Increased expansion on the affected side</li><li>Hyperresonance on the affected side</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-NS9 aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-NS9 data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-NS9><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> C</p><strong>Tension pneumothorax</strong> is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart.<br><br>Tension pneumothorax features include:<br>1.

The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of <strong>acute cholecystitis</strong>, which is associated with gallstones in more than 90% of all cases.<br>2. This condition occurs when a stone becomes impacted in the cystic duct and inflammation develops behind the obstruction.<br>3. The acute attack is often precipitated by a large fatty meal, and is characterized by the sudden appearance of severe, steady pain localized to the epigastrium or right hypochondrium. Laboratory findings often include elevated white blood cells (2,000 - 15,000/μL). Total serum bilirubin values of 1-4 mg/dL may be seen in some instances, and serum amylase may be elevated. In non-complicated cases, treatment often includes IV alimentation, analgesics, and antibiotics, as well as withholding of oral feedings. <br>4. <strong>Meperidine</strong> is the narcotic of choice since it is least likely to cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, probably because of its antimuscarinic properties. It is therefore preferred over morphine , oxycodone , and propoxyphene. <br>5. <strong>Naproxen</strong> is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate pain; this agent would most likely not provide sufficient pain control for this patient.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>17. </span> A 28-year-old man brought to the emergency room with multiple injuries to the abdomen and chest.

Although protected under the bony ribcage, the spleen remains the most commonly affected organ in blunt injury to the abdomen in all age groups. <br>2. Splenic injury most commonly occurs following blunt trauma due to motor vehicle collisions (driver, passenger, or pedestrian). However, blunt splenic injury can also result from falls, sport-related activities, or assault.<br>3. The clinical presentation of splenic injury is highly variable. Most patients with minor focal injury to the spleen complain of left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Left shoulder tenderness may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic nerve root irritation with referred pain.<br>4. CT scan with contrast is the diagnostic modality of choice as it identifies splenic injury with good accuracy. <br>5. Management of splenic trauma caused by blunt abdominal injury depends on the patient's hemodynamic status and response to IV fluids. <br>6. Surgical therapy is usually reserved for patients with signs of ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability. <br>7. If removal is unavoidable, post-operative immunization against encapsulated bacteria is mandatory. <br>8. the patient is hemodynamically unstable and unresponsive to fluid administration, then emergent exploratory laparotomy is required.<br>9. If the patient responds to fluids and does not require blood, performing an abdominal CT scan is the best next step. <br>10.

Gallstones can be divided into 2 categories: Cholesterol stones (80%) and pigment stones (20%). <br>2. Most patients with gallstones are asymptomatic. <br>3. Cholecystitis occurs when obstruction at the cystic duct is prolonged resulting in inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Acute cholecystitis develops in approximately 20% of patients with biliary colic if they are left untreated. <br>4. Acute cholecystitis usually presents with sudden onset of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and leukocytosis.<br>5. The pain may radiate to the right scapula or be accompanied by Murphy's sign (pain with palpation of the gallbladder fossa beneath the liver edge during inspiration).<br>6. Classical findings include fever, vomiting, and leukocytosis. Uncomplicated cholecystitis can cause mild elevations in transaminases and total serum bilirubin.<br>7. In the elderly, fever may not develop, and the first or only symptoms may be systemic and nonspecific (eg, anorexia, vomiting, malaise, weakness, fever). <br>8. Risk factors for biliary colic and cholecystitis include pregnancy, elderly population, obesity, weight loss, and liver transplant patients.<br>9. Some oral contraceptives or estrogen replacement therapy may increase the risk of gallstones. <br>10. Ultrasonography is usually favored as the initial test.<br>11. Asymptomatic gallstones should not be treated.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are relatively common and are potentially life-threatening. Patients at greatest risk for AAA are men who are older than 65 years and have peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease. <br>2. An expanding AAA causes sudden, severe, and constant low back, flank, abdominal, or groin pain. Syncope may be the chief complaint, however, with pain less prominent.<br>3. Most clinically significant AAAs are palpable upon routine physical examination. <br>4. The presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass is virtually diagnostic but is found in fewer than half of all cases.<br>5. Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm constitutes an AAA.<br>6. The most common cause is atherosclerosis.<br>7. Most aneurysms grow slowly without causing symptoms, but some patients develop steady, deep pain in the lumbosacral region. Risk of rupture is proportional to the size of the aneurysm. <br>8. Risk of rupture is proportional to the size of the aneurysm.<br>9.

Up to 70% of patients with gallstones are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.<br>2. Biliary colic is the most common presentation, caused by a gallstone impacting in the cystic duct or the ampulla of Vater.<br>3. The three major types of gallstones are cholesterol stones, pigment stones (chiefly composed of calcium bilirubinate), and mixed stones. <br>4. Ultrasound Is the best way to demonstrate stones, being 90-95% sensitive.<br>5. Urinalysis, CXR and ECG may help exclude other diseases.<br>6.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are relatively common and are potentially life-threatening. Patients at greatest risk for AAA are men who are older than 65 years and have peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease. <br>2. An expanding AAA causes sudden, severe, and constant low back, flank, abdominal, or groin pain. Syncope may be the chief complaint, however, with pain less prominent.<br>3. Most clinically significant AAAs are palpable upon routine physical examination. <br>4. The presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass is virtually diagnostic but is found in fewer than half of all cases.<br>5. Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm constitutes an AAA.<br>6. The most common cause is atherosclerosis.<br>7. Most aneurysms grow slowly without causing symptoms, but some patients develop steady, deep pain in the lumbosacral region.<br>8. Risk of rupture is proportional to the size of the aneurysm.<br>9. Diagnose using ultrasonography or CT; for unruptured aneurysms, CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography can more precisely characterize aneurysm size and anatomy.<br>10.

The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> classic acute appendicitis</span> symptoms are: epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by brief nausea, vomiting, and anorexia Patients with classic symptoms and signs should have laparotomy instead of imaging tests.<br>2. Patients with nondiagnostic findings should have imaging with CT or, particularly for children, ultrasonography<br>3. Give a 3rd-generation cephalosporin preoperatively and, if the appendix has perforated, continue it postoperatively.<br>4. Although appendicitis is most common in children and young adults, it is still common in the geriatric population, occurring in up to 14% of cases of acute abdomen.<br>5. The geriatric population has a higher incidence of appendiceal rupture and higher mortality from appendicitis than patients in other age groups.<br>6. Geriatric patients are more likely to present with a diffuse abdominal pain and often have a normal white blood cell count.<br>7. Appendicitis is thought to result from obstruction of the appendiceal lumen, typically by lymphoid hyperplasia, but occasionally by a fecalith, foreign body, or even worms. The obstruction leads to distention, bacterial overgrowth, ischemia, and inflammation. If untreated, necrosis, gangrene, and perforation occur.<br>8. <strong>Diagnosis</strong> is clinical, often supplemented by CT or ultrasonography.<br>9. <strong>Treatment</strong> is surgical removal of the appendix.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>57. </span> Which of the following is the best test for diagnosing and evaluating acute episode of diverticulitis? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>CT</li><li>Ultrasound</li><li>MRI</li><li>Barium enemas</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-V2A aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-V2A data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-V2A><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> A</p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diverticulitis</span></strong> <br>1.

Although protected under the bony ribcage, the spleen remains the most commonly affected organ in blunt injury to the abdomen in all age groups. <br>2. Splenic injury most commonly occurs following blunt trauma due to motor vehicle collisions (driver, passenger, or pedestrian). However, blunt splenic injury can also result from falls, sport-related activities, or assault.<br>3. The clinical presentation of splenic injury is highly variable. Most patients with minor focal injury to the spleen complain of left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Left shoulder tenderness may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic nerve root irritation with referred pain.<br>4. CT scan with contrast is the diagnostic modality of choice as it identifies splenic injury with good accuracy. <br>5. Management of splenic trauma caused by blunt abdominal injury depends on the patient's hemodynamic status and response to IV fluids. <br>6. Surgical therapy is usually reserved for patients with signs of ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability. <br>7. If removal is unavoidable, post-operative immunization against encapsulated bacteria is mandatory. <br>8. the patient is hemodynamically unstable and unresponsive to fluid administration, then emergent exploratory laparotomy is required.<br>9.

It is a medical emergency.<br><br>1. <strong>Gas gangrene</strong> is caused by an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus of the genus Clostridium.<br>2. C perfringens is the most common etiologic agent that causes gas gangrene. Other common clostridial species that cause gas gangrene include Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium fallax, Clostridium histolyticum, and Clostridium tertium.<br>3. Gas gangrene can be classified as posttraumatic, postoperative, or spontaneous.<br>4. Posttraumatic gas gangrene accounts for 60% of all gas gangrene cases<br>5. The typical incubation period for gas gangrene is frequently short (ie, &lt; 24 h), but incubation periods of 1 hour to 6 weeks have been reported.<br>6. Most patients with posttraumatic gas gangrene have sustained serious injury to the skin or soft tissues or have experienced open fractures. Patients with postoperative gas gangrene have frequently undergone recent surgery of the GI or biliary tract.<br>7. A sudden onset of pain is usually the first symptom of gas gangrene. The pain gradually worsens but spreads only as the underlying infection spreads.<br>8. Some patients report a feeling of heaviness in the affected extremity.<br>9. A low-grade fever and apathetic mental status may develop.<br>10. The typical signs and symptoms of gas gangrene include severe pain and tenderness, local swelling to massive edema, skin discoloration with hemorrhagic blebs and bullae, nonodorous or sweet odor, crepitus, fever, relative tachycardia, and altered mental status.<br>11. The combination of aggressive surgical debridement and effective antibiotic therapy is the determining factor for successful treatment of gas gangrene.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>66. </span> For an newborn with asymptomatic umbilical hernia.

The infection classically arises from an infected 2nd or 3rd mandibular molar tooth. <br>3. Causative organisms are Streptococcus (S. mutans) and anaerobes. <br>4. The patient will present with fever, dysphagia, drooling, stridor and cyanosis. <br>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Physical examination</strong></span> reveals firm induration in the submandibular space; the presence of anaerobes may cause crepitus due to gas formation. <br><strong>6. Sudden asphyxiation is the most common cause of death in patients with Ludwig's angina</strong><br>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span> include removal of the infected tooth and intravenous antibiotics.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>68. </span> A 77-year-old man is complaining of immediate need to urinate, followed by the loss of urine. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Overflow incontinence</li><li>Stress incontinence</li><li>Urge incontinence</li><li>Functional incontinence</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-5PN aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-5PN data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-5PN><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> C</p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Urge incontinence:</strong></span> Involuntary leakage accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency.<br>2.

Inflammation of gallbladder commonly caused by gallstone obstruction of cystic duct; acalculous cholecystitis can occur in patients on TPN or in those who are critically ill <br>2. Gallstones can be divided into 2 categories: <strong>Cholesterol stones (80%)</strong> and pigment stones (20%). <br>3. Most patients with gallstones are asymptomatic.<br>4. Choledocholithiasis occurs when the stone becomes lodged in the common bile duct, with the potential sequelae of cholangitis and ascending infections.<br>5. Clinical features: RUQ pain radiating to back, nausea, vomiting, anorexia; fever, palpable gallbladder, RUQ tenderness; symptoms more severe and longer in duration than typical cholelithiasis.<br>6. P<strong>ain is a prominent feature of cholecystitis</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The classic teaching is that <strong>morphine</strong> is not the agent of choice because of the possibility of <strong>increasing tone at the sphincter of Oddi</strong></span>. Meperidine has been shown to provide adequate analgesia without affecting the sphincter of Oddi and, therefore, is the drug of choice.<br>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span> hydration, antibiotics, cholecystectomy (frequently delayed after 24 to 48 hours of supportive care); patients with more mild symptoms can be treated with lithotripsy and bile salts; patients who are not stable for surgery can be treated with ERCP delivery of stone solvents.<br>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Complications</strong></span> perforation, gallstone ileus, abscess formation</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>70. </span> A 26-year old female athlete presents to the doctor with pain in her left leg.

Stress fractures are small incomplete fractures that often involve the metatarsal shafts. They are caused by repetitive weight-bearing stress.<br>2. Bones most commonly involved in stress fractures are metatarsal, navicular, neck of femur and tibia. <br>3. Forefoot pain that occurs after a long or intense workout, then disappears shortly after stopping exercise is the typical initial manifestation of a metatarsal stress fracture. With subsequent exercise, onset of pain is progressively earlier, and pain may become so severe that it prohibits exercise and persists even when patients are not bearing weight.<br>4. Standard x-rays are recommended but may be normal until a callus forms 2 to 3 wk after the injury.<br>5. Treatment includes cessation of weight bearing on the involved foot (in case patients have a metatarsal stress fracture) and use of crutches.<br>6. Healing can take anywhere from 6 to 12 wk.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>71. </span> A 14 year old male presents to the clinic with a swelling on the floor of his mouth.

Ranulas are a rare benign acquired cystic lesions that occur at the floor of mouth as submandibular or minor salivary glands retention cysts. <br>2. Ranulas arise either spontaneously or as a result of trauma to the floor of mouth, including surgery. They result from obstruction of a sublingual gland or adjacent minor salivary gland with resultant formation of a mucous retention cyst.<br>3. Ranulas are usually asymptomatic. <br>4. Surgical resection is curative but requires not only excision of the cystic component but also of the parent sublingual gland.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>72. </span> In children, hematogenous osteomyelitis most commonly affects which of the following? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Metaphysis of long bones</li><li>Hyaline cartilage</li><li>Diaphysis</li><li>Epiphysis</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-DC0 aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-DC0 data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-DC0><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> A</p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pediatric Osteomyelitis</strong></span><br><br>1. Osteomyelitis, or inflammation of the bone,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> is usually caused by bacterial infection</span>.<br>2. Bone infections in children are primarily hematogenous in origin, although cases secondary to penetrating trauma, surgery, or infection in a contiguous site are also reported.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Fever, bone pain, swelling, redness, and guarding the affected body part are common.</strong></span><br>4. Inability to support weight and asymmetric movement of extremities are often early signs in newborns and young infants<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5. Long bones, including the femur, tibia, and humerus, are most commonly affected.</strong></span><br>6. Circulating organisms tend to start the infection in the metaphyseal ends of the long bones because of the sluggish circulation in the metaphyseal capillary loops.<br>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On examination</strong></span> patients are able to localize the infected bone owing to pain.<br>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Symptoms</strong></span> include focal swelling with cardinal signs of inflammation with or without fever and focal point tenderness over the affected bone.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>73. </span> Winging of the scapula due to injury of which of the following? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Axillary nerve</li><li>Suprascapular nerve</li><li>Median nerve</li><li>Long thoracic nerve</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-XYW aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-XYW data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-XYW><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> D</p>1. The long thoracic nerve is a posterior branch from the C5, C6 and C7 roots of the brachial plexus, and supplies the serratus anterior muscle. <br>2. A winged scapula can result from injury to the long thoracic nerve. <br>3. Damage to the nerve may also occur during surgical procedures including thoracoplasty, axillary nodal clearance, mastectomy and resection of the first rib. The risk of injury to the long thoracic nerve is far greater in patients following a radical mastectomy (with clearance of the axillary lymph nodes) compared with simple mastectomy. <br>4.

The classic presentation is intermittent bloody discharge from one nipple. Mammogram is needed to identify other potential lesions, but it will not show the papilloma (they are tiny). Galactogram or Ultrasound may be diagnostic and guide surgical resection. Ultrasound is best at detecting masses greater than 1 cm in diameter However, any patient with a bloody nipple discharge is cancer until proven otherwise. <br><br><strong>Fibroadenomas</strong> are typically smooth, rounded, mobile, painless masses; they may be mistaken for cancer. They usually develop in women during their reproductive years and may decrease in size over time. Juvenile fibroadenoma, a variant, occurs in adolescents, and unlike fibroadenomas in older women, these fibroadenomas continue to grow over time. Simple fibroadenoma does not appear to increase risk of breast cancer; complex fibroadenoma may increase risk slightly.<br><br><strong>Fibrocystic changes</strong> (previously, fibrocystic disease) is a catchall term that refers to mastalgia, breast cysts, and nondescript masses (usually in the upper outer part of the breast); these findings may occur in isolation or together. Breasts have a nodular and dense texture and are frequently tender when palpated. Fibrocystic changes cause the most commonly reported breast symptoms and have many causes. Fibrocystic changes are not associated with increased risk of cancer.<br><br><strong>Breast infections (mastitis)</strong> cause pain, erythema, and swelling; an abscess can produce a discrete mass. Infections are extremely rare except during the puerperium (postpartum) or after penetrating trauma. They may occur after breast surgery. Puerperal mastitis, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus, can cause massive inflammation and severe breast pain, sometimes with an abscess. If infection occurs under other circumstances, an underlying cancer should be sought promptly.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>78. </span> Which of the following nerve injuries is associated with foot drop? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Radial</li><li>Peroneal</li><li>Median</li><li>Ulnar</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-MIR aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-MIR data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-MIR><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p>1.

These gallstones typically form in conditions of stasis (e.g., parenteral nutrition) or excess unconjugated bilirubin (e.g., hemolysis or cirrhosis).<br>8. Brown pigment stones are composed of calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin with small amounts of cholesterol and protein. These stones are often located in bile ducts causing obstruction and are usually found in conditions where there is infected bile. <br>9. Gallstone disease may not be symptomatic until there are complications. Often these complications are caused by inflammation, infection, or ductal obstruction.<br>10. Complications of calculous disease include: acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, cholecystenteric fistulae, Mirizzi’s syndrome, and porcelain gallbladder.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>90. </span> A 2­1-year ­old male with left­ sided mass that feels like a bag of worms, the left testicle is smaller than normal, the mass increases in size with valsalva maneuver.Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? </p><ol class=mt-3 type=A><li>Testicular torsion</li><li>Varicocele</li><li>Hydrocele</li><li>Torsion of the testicular appendage</li></ol><button aria-controls=explanation-G70 aria-expanded=false class="btn btn-secondary" data-target=#explanation-G70 data-toggle=collapse type=button><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Explain</button><div class="collapse explanation-text rounded p-4 mt-3" id=explanation-G70><p class=correct-answer><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Varicoceles</span></strong>  <br> 1.

Although protected under the bony ribcage, the spleen remains the most commonly affected organ in blunt injury to the abdomen in all age groups. <br>2. Splenic injury most commonly occurs following blunt trauma due to motor vehicle collisions (driver, passenger, or pedestrian). However, blunt splenic injury can also result from falls, sport-related activities, or assault.<br>3. The clinical presentation of splenic injury is highly variable. Most patients with minor focal injury to the spleen complain of left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Left shoulder tenderness may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic nerve root irritation with referred pain.<br>4. CT scan with contrast is the diagnostic modality of choice as it identifies splenic injury with good accuracy. <br>5. Management of splenic trauma caused by blunt abdominal injury depends on the patient's hemodynamic status and response to IV fluids. <br>6. Surgical therapy is usually reserved for patients with signs of ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability. <br>7.

Dupuytren disease is a fibrosing disorder that results in slowly progressive thickening and shorting of the palmar fascia and leads to debilitating digital contractures, particularly of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints or the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. This condition usually affects the fourth and fifth digits (the ring and small fingers).  <br>3. <strong>The earliest manifestation</strong> is usually a tender nodule in the palm, most often near the middle or ring finger; it gradually becomes painless.

These individuals are predisposed to foot infections because of a compromised vascular supply secondary to diabetes. <br>3. Local trauma and/or pressure (often in association with lack of sensation because of neuropathy), in addition to microvascular disease, may result in various diabetic foot infections that run the spectrum from simple, superficial cellulitis to chronic osteomyelitis.<br>4. Infections in patients with diabetes are difficult to treat because these individuals have impaired microvascular circulation, which limits the access of phagocytic cells to the infected area and results in a poor concentration of antibiotics in the infected tissues.<br>5. Cellulitis is the easiest diabetic foot infection to cure, because it does not pose the same circulatory limitations that the more serious infections do, making it easier for medications to reach the infection site. <br>6. In contrast, chronic osteomyelitis, which is the most difficult diabetic foot infection to cure, requires surgical debridement before antibiotic therapy can be effective.<br>7.Bone fragments that are isolated have no blood supply; systemic antibiotics do not penetrate these devascularized, infected bone fragments. Therefore, antibiotic therapy alone cannot cure patients with chronic osteomyelitis.<br>8.Adequate surgical debridement, in addition to antimicrobial therapy, is necessary to cure chronic osteomyelitis. Immobilization is important in acute or chronic osteomyelitis.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>119. </span> A 26-year-old man involved in a fight brought to the emergency room with multiple injuries to the chest and abdomen.

Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common thyroid malignancy, and the most common form of thyroid cancer to result from exposure to radiation. Papillary carcinoma appears as an irregular solid or cystic mass or nodule in a normal thyroid parenchyma. <br>2. The most common presentation of thyroid cancer is an asymptomatic thyroid mass or a nodule that can be felt in the neck.<br>3. Some patients with thyroid cancer have persistent cough, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing. Pain is seldom an early warning sign of thyroid cancer. <br>4. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is considered the best first-line diagnostic procedure for a thyroid nodule <br>5. Surgery is the definitive management of papillary thyroid cancer. Approximately 4-6 weeks after surgical thyroid removal, patients may have radioiodine therapy to detect and destroy any metastasis and residual tissue in the thyroid.</div></div><div class="question-container mb-4 pt-4"><p class=question-text><span class=question-number>124. </span> A 61-year old male comes to the emergency room complaining of abdominal pain that started three days ago.

An anal fissure is an acute longitudinal tear or a chronic ovoid ulcer in the squamous epithelium of the anal canal.<br>2. It causes severe pain, sometimes with bleeding, particularly with defecation.<br>3. Diagnosis is by inspection.<br>4. Diverticulosis is the most common cause of painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding <br>5. With internal hemorrhoids, the only symptom may be rectal bleeding. Bright red blood may appear as streaks on toilet paper or stool, or bright red blood that drips into the toilet following bowel movements. Other symptoms include a lump that can be felt around the anus with or without associated pain (usually from external hemorrhoids), or itching or mucus discharge after bowel movements. Hemorrhoids generally last several days and often recur. <br>6. Anal fissures often cause pain during and after a bowel movement, sometimes followed by throbbing pain for several hours.<br>7.

The overall diagnostic accuracy achieved by traditional history, physical examination, and laboratory tests has been approximately 80%. The accuracy of diagnosis varies and is more difficult in women of childbearing age, children, and elderly persons. If the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is clear from the history and physical examination, prompt surgical referral is warranted. In atypical presentations, ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) may help lower the rate of false-negative appendicitis diagnoses, reduce morbidity from perforation, and lower medical expenses. Ultrasonography is safe and readily available, with accuracy rates between 71% and 97%, although it is highly operator dependent and difficult in patients with a large body habitus. Although there is controversy regarding the use of contrast media and which CT technique is best, the accuracy rate of CT scanning is between 93% and 98%.

Splenic injury usually results from blunt abdominal trauma. Patients often have abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the shoulder, and tenderness.<br>2. Splenic injury is common and can occur with minimal trauma if the spleen is enlarged.<br>3. The manifestations of major hemorrhage, including hemorrhagic shock, abdominal pain, and distention, are usually clinically obvious. Lesser hemorrhage causes left upper quadrant abdominal pain, which sometimes radiates to the left shoulder. <br>4. The diagnosis is confirmed with CT in stable patients and with bedside ultrasonography or exploratory laparotomy in unstable patients.<br>5. Treatment is with observation and sometimes surgical repair; rarely, splenectomy is necessary.<br>6. Patients with significant ongoing hemorrhage (ie, significant ongoing transfusion requirements and/or declining Hct) require laparotomy.<br>7. Splenectomy should be avoided if possible, particularly in children, the elderly, and patients with hematologic malignancy, to avoid the resulting permanent susceptibility to bacterial infections, increasing the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy sepsis. The most common pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae, but other encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria sp. and Haemophilus sp. may also be involved.<br>8.

Although protected under the bony ribcage, the spleen remains the most commonly affected organ in blunt injury to the abdomen in all age groups. <br>2. Splenic injury most commonly occurs following blunt trauma due to motor vehicle collisions (driver, passenger, or pedestrian). However, blunt splenic injury can also result from falls, sport-related activities, or assault.<br>3. The clinical presentation of splenic injury is highly variable. Most patients with minor focal injury to the spleen complain of left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Left shoulder tenderness may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic nerve root irritation with referred pain.<br>4. CT scan with contrast is the diagnostic modality of choice as it identifies splenic injury with good accuracy. <br>5. Management of splenic trauma caused by blunt abdominal injury depends on the patient's hemodynamic status and response to IV fluids. <br>6. Surgical therapy is usually reserved for patients with signs of ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability. <br>7. If removal is unavoidable, post-operative immunization against encapsulated bacteria is mandatory. <br>8. the patient is hemodynamically unstable and unresponsive to fluid administration, then emergent exploratory laparotomy is required.<br>9. If the patient responds to fluids and does not require blood, performing an abdominal CT scan is the best next step. <br><strong>10.

Splenic injury usually results from blunt abdominal trauma. Patients often have abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the shoulder, and tenderness.<br>2. Splenic injury is common and can occur with minimal trauma if the spleen is enlarged.<br>3. The manifestations of major hemorrhage, including hemorrhagic shock, abdominal pain, and distention, are usually clinically obvious. Lesser hemorrhage causes left upper quadrant abdominal pain, which sometimes radiates to the left shoulder. <br>4. The diagnosis is confirmed with CT in stable patients and with bedside ultrasonography or exploratory laparotomy in unstable patients.<br>5. Treatment is with observation and sometimes surgical repair; rarely, splenectomy is necessary.<br>6. Patients with significant ongoing hemorrhage (ie, significant ongoing transfusion requirements and/or declining Hct) require laparotomy.<br>7. Splenectomy should be avoided if possible, particularly in children, the elderly, and patients with hematologic malignancy, to avoid the resulting permanent susceptibility to bacterial infections, increasing the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy sepsis. The most common pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae, but other encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria sp. and Haemophilus sp. may also be involved.<br>8.
